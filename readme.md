# adrilight web

this is the source for the supporting website of adrilight to provide content for the whats new page

## why???

So the content for the whats new page could be provided as static content but this way also provides a notification channel to inform users, if the automatic updating breaks (again) for example!

## whats next?

you should visit the actual [adrilight github](https://github.com/fabsenet/adrilight/) instead!
